# Blockworld
C++ and OpenGL Voxel Demo

# Build
Link the OpenGL library, verify existing references and compile in your favorite IDE. Please note that this application does not work on MacOS and Linux. 

# Description
For archive purposes I decided to Open Source this project I made during my C++ and OpenGL classes more than a year ago. It contains the fundamentals of a voxel game, where a world exists of many (large) blocks.
